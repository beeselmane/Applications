# Applications

This repository includes the source code for a bunch of applications that I've written over the years.

Same as the commands repo, some of these probably work, some of them probably don't, and some probably don't even make much sense. The difference with this one is that it doesn't include any of my finished app projects. The only apps in this repo are those which are either unfinished, tests, or apps which play with obscure or private featurs of some API/SDK/OS.

I make no claims as to anything here. In fact, I'm just going to say that it's all public domain. That's right. Anything in this repository not otherwise covered by some license is as of now in the public domain. You're welcome. A note about this repo is that there is a higher chance that some code is covered by a license not explicitely mentioned. So use at your own risk, I suppose.

Again, I didn't even read through most of these before uploading them, so I have no clue what you may find. Have fun!
